# Collected Data
---
Data SDK collects 5 types of behavioral data, Permission, Device, Geolocation, Wi-Fi, and App related information, automatically. Besides, there are still some other optional data types you can collect if your App fits the requirements. Please contact datasdk.support@vpon.com for further supports.

| Permission    | opt_in              | Users agree to let we, App developer and business partner, collect their data. | To record user's permission. If the user does not "opt-in", we will not collect the sample.                                                                          |
| Permission    | limited_ad_tracking | Users turn on "limit ad tracking" function in the device's privacy settings.   | If the users choose to turn on "limit ad tracking" function, we can not identify the device ID value. Hence, we will not provide personalized contents to the users. |
|Device               |device_ID_type                     |Mobile Advertising ID of the device. IDFA for iOS, ADID (GAID) for Android. Can not identify one person, can only identify the device. If the user did restrict access to the Mobile Advertising ID, which means turning on "limit ad tracking" function, we will not collect the related sample. If the user did reset the Mobile Advertising ID, we will collect the sample of resetted Mobile Advertising ID.|To provide personalized content to the users for better user experience, e.g., based on the user's in-App behavior, provide more relevant contents to the user.|
