**Permission**

Vpon Data SDK requires very limited permissions from App users. Based on the collected data type, all we need are geolocation and network permissions.

The details are shown as follows:

**Android**
* geolocation: 
    * ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION
* network:
    * ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE
    * ACCESS_WIFI_STATE
    * CHANGE_WIFI_STATE
    * READ_PHONE_STATE

**iOS**

  * Need Location Authority
  * Add LocationUsageDescription: 
    +NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription
    +NSLocationUsageDescription
